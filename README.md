# Java Electric Vehicle Project 

The details of how the class structure utilizes OOD principles can be found in the Modeling an Electric Vehicle using Java.docx. The Driver.java file is used to run the user interface and is where all of the other classes are instantiated. Each class represents a part of a vehicle and requires parameters specific to the type of vehicle you are trying to model. When running the Driver class the user can play the simulation to get information like amps used, force in horsepower, and speed in mph.
